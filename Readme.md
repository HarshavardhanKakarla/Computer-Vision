## Projects Included

### 1. Eye-Controlled Mouse
This project uses **real-time eye tracking** to control the mouse pointer on your computer screen. The application identifies eye movements to move the cursor and detects blinks to simulate mouse clicks. It utilizes **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI** for accurate eye tracking and interaction.

**Features**:
- Cursor movement based on eye tracking.
- Blink detection for click actions.
- Interactive and user-friendly setup.

---

### 2. Virtual Keyboard
The Virtual Keyboard project allows users to type using their hands and gestures instead of a physical keyboard. It employs **hand tracking** and **gesture detection** to enable typing in a seamless and futuristic way. The keyboard is displayed on-screen, and hand gestures are mapped to virtual key presses.

**Features**:
- Real-time hand gesture detection.
- Interactive virtual keyboard interface.
- Save and clear functionality for typed text.

---

### 3. Virtual Calculator
The Virtual Calculator combines **hand gesture recognition** with **AI analysis** to let users draw mathematical equations in real-time. The drawn equations are processed and solved using Google's **Generative AI**. The application also features a dynamic virtual canvas for drawing and erasing.

**Features**:
- Gesture-based drawing on a virtual canvas.
- AI-powered analysis and solutions for equations.
- Real-time blending of the canvas with the webcam feed.
